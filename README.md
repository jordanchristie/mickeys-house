# The Why

My wife and my son love Disney marginally more than they love me. As our trips to the Most Magical Place on Earth will most likely be a frequent thing, I figured I should see if I could tap a Disney API for some goodies. Maybe I could catch some of the magic too.

# Tech Stack

I am currently using the following tools:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) / [Express](https://expressjs.com) for the backend
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) for the layer over the API endpoints
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the client side
- [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) for the full-stack GraphQL implementation
- [StyledComponents](https://www.styled-components.com/) for styling and animation

# To-Do's

1. Find an appropriate hosting platform for a full-stack JS app.

2. Learn ThemeParks API v5 so I can reintegrate wait times into the rideHelper endpoint (v4 was so much simpler).
